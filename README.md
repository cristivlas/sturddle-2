# sturddle-chess-engine
This chess engine was written from scratch, with ideas taken from Wikipedia, https://www.chessprogramming.org/
and The Computer Chess Compendium by David Levy et al.

Some concepts may have been misunderstood, or implemented incorrectly. The code structure may appear 
convoluted or over-engineered, as I tried to separate different concepts and be able to turn features
on and off at either compile-time or run-time, for experimental and self-teaching purposes.

For the most part I have not looked at other engines (I did peek at Stockfish in later development, in order
to grasp the Singular Extension idea) which also explains the somewhat "non-standard" code layout and naming.
